//DIAMOND PROBLEM ----- IT IS AN ISSUE SEEN WITH MULTIPLE INHERITANCE
// IT HAPPENS WHEN CHILD CLASS TRIES TO INHERIT FROM 2 PARENT CLASS MAKING A DIAMOND SHAPE INHERITANCE HIERARCHY

// BY USING CLASSES , MULTIPLE INHERITANCE IS NOT POSSIBLE , IT CAN BE USED WITH ABSTRACTION


//public class son extends fatherf1,fatherf2{
    // This is not possible
    // MULTIPLE INHERITANCE IS NOT POSSIBLE IN JAVA because one child class cannot extend two or more parent class
    // JVM gets confused which father class's attributes and behavior is being referred to
    // this is why MULTIPLE INHERITANCE IS NOT POSSIBLE
//}
